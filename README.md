# smart-startup-validator

**A blockchain-powered validation tool for startup founders, powered by Bolt.AI and built on the Stacks blockchain.**

## ✨ What It Does

Smart Startup Validator analyzes your startup idea using AI and gives a **go/no-go decision**, along with:

- Market size estimation
- Competitor analysis
- A suggested pitch deck link
- Optional feedback
- Transparent, verifiable records on the Stacks blockchain

It helps you **avoid bad bets**, focus on what works, and gives early proof you can show investors or teammates.

> "Startup validation shouldn't be a guessing game."

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Startup founders waste time building ideas without real data. This validator uses AI to cut through bias and provide:
- Transparent reasoning,
- Objective decisions,
- And **permanent blockchain records** that prove you were serious — first.

## 💡 How Blockchain Makes It Better

- **Immutable Records**: Your idea’s validation is stored on-chain for future reference.
- **Proof of Validation**: Show investors or cofounders what the AI said and when.
- **Decentralized Credibility**: No backend tampering, no edits after the fact.
